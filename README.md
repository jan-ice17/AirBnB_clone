## AirBnB Clone - The Console (JANICE GATHOGA)

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project's command-line interface! This project aims to build a simplified version of AirBnB where you can manage various objects using a Python-based command interpreter.

### Description

This project involves creating a Python command-line interface (CLI) to manage objects in an AirBnB clone application. It includes functionalities such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects like User, State, City, Place, etc. The CLI interacts with these objects through serialization and deserialization processes, utilizing JSON files for data storage.


### How to Use It?

Once you've launched the console, you'll see a prompt `(hbnb)`, indicating that you are inside the AirBnB console environment. You can start entering commands to manage objects. Here are some basic commands:

- `help`: Displays a list of available commands with their descriptions.
- `quit` or `EOF`: Exits the AirBnB console.
- `create <class_name>`: Creates a new instance of the specified class.
- `show <class_name> <id>`: Displays details of the specified instance.
- `destroy <class_name> <id>`: Deletes the specified instance.
- `update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value>`: Updates attributes of the specified instance.
